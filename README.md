# Providing Advice As a Real Estate Agent for Kent County Houses

## Overview

This project aims to provide advice to home buyers and sellers in Kent County. For sellers, the aim is to develop a machine learning model that can predict a house's price given its various features, so that the seller will decide on the selling price. On the other hand, the predicted price will help the buyer to understand if the house is marketed at a fair price. Another goal of the project is to provide advice on renovations, if that will help increase the price or not,

The data is provided by Flatiron school and collected from the Kaggle.

## Business Problem


I develop this project for a real estate agency that makes recommendations to sellers on home renovations and to buyers/sellers on the price of the house. The problems I will focus on are below:

Will the price of the house increase if renovation is done?

Is the seller's price reasonable for the house given the attributes?
